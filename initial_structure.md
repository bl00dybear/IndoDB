Prompt: i want to create from scratch a database management system with C and haskell for the parser. explain to me the arhitecture of the whole application, the operations tree for the parser, the pagination for the content stored as we expect it to be somewhat large. the database will be similar to the sqlite dmbs as it would all be in one file. we will use a b tree for efficient index searching, transactions and at first only basic sql statements for crud 


Creating a **Database Management System (DBMS)** from scratch using **C** for the core engine and **Haskell** for the SQL parser is a challenging but rewarding project. Below, I will break down the **architecture**, **parser operation tree**, and **storage mechanisms** such as **pagination** and **B-tree indexing**.

---

## **1. Architecture Overview**

The architecture consists of multiple layers, each responsible for a different part of the DBMS.

### **Layers of the DBMS**
1. **SQL Parser (Haskell)**  
   - Parses SQL statements into an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**.
   - Validates syntax and transforms it into an **operation tree**.
   - Passes the parsed commands to the **execution engine**.

2. **Query Execution Engine (C)**
   - Translates the AST into actual database operations.
   - Handles CRUD operations by interacting with the storage engine.
   - Manages transactions and query optimization.

3. **Storage Engine (C)**
   - Manages the database file and structures data efficiently.
   - Implements a **B-Tree index** for fast lookups.
   - Uses **paging** to efficiently store and retrieve data.

4. **Transaction Management (C)**
   - Ensures ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
   - Implements write-ahead logging (WAL) for durability.
   - Supports concurrent operations with locks.

5. **Networking Layer (Optional)**
   - If you want to support client-server architecture in the future.

## **2. SQL Parser and Operations Tree (Haskell)**

### **Parsing Process**
1. Tokenize the SQL statement.
2. Parse the tokens into an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**.
3. Convert the AST into an **operation tree** for execution.

### **Example: SQL Query**
```sql
SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE age > 25;
```

### **Corresponding AST**
```haskell
data SQLStatement
    = Select [Column] Table [Condition]
    | Insert Table [Column] [Value]
    | Update Table [(Column, Value)] [Condition]
    | Delete Table [Condition]
    deriving (Show)

data Column = Column String deriving (Show)
data Table = Table String deriving (Show)
data Value = IntVal Int | StrVal String deriving (Show)
data Condition = Condition Column String Value deriving (Show)
```

### **Example Operation Tree**
For the above query, the tree would look like:

```
          Select
         /   |   \
      name  age  Filter(age > 25)
                     |
                   Table(users)
```

The **operation tree** will then be passed to the execution engine in C.

---

## **3. Storage and Pagination System**

Since the database is stored as **one file**, we need a way to efficiently manage large data. We use **paging**, where data is split into fixed-size **pages** stored in the file.

### **Page Structure**
- **Page Size:** 4KB (configurable)
- **Page Types:**
  - **Header Page** (Metadata, schema)
  - **Table Page** (Rows of a table)
  - **Index Page** (B-Tree nodes)
  - **Free Page** (Unused space)

Each page is identified by a **Page ID** and stored as binary data in the file.

### **Row Storage Example**
Each row is stored in a table page like:
```
| Row ID | Column1 | Column2 | Column3 | ... |
```

If the row is too large, it is split into **multiple pages**, linked together.

---

## **4. B-Tree Index for Efficient Searching**

A **B-Tree** is used to store indexes for quick lookups.

### **B-Tree Structure**
Each node contains:
```
[Key1, Pointer1, Key2, Pointer2, Key3, Pointer3]
```
- **Keys** are sorted values.
- **Pointers** point to either child nodes (if not a leaf) or data pages (if leaf).

### **Example**
For the table:
```
ID | Name  | Age
1  | Alice | 30
2  | Bob   | 25
3  | Eve   | 35
```
A B-Tree on `Age` would store:
```
       [30]
      /    \
   [25]   [35]
```
Searching for `Age > 25` will traverse the tree efficiently.

---

## **5. Transactions and Concurrency Control**

### **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**
- Before modifying data, a log entry is written to a **WAL file**.
- This allows **rollback** in case of failure.

### **Concurrency Control**
- **Locking Mechanism** (Row-level locks or Page-level locks)
- **MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)** (Optional for better performance)

---

## **6. Basic CRUD Operations Implementation**

### **Insert (SQL → Execution)**
```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Alice', 30);
```
- Haskell Parser → Creates an operation tree.
- C Execution Engine:
  - Finds free space in table pages.
  - Stores the new row.
  - Updates B-Tree index.

### **Select**
```sql
SELECT name FROM users WHERE age > 25;
```
- Uses B-Tree index to quickly find matching rows.
- Reads the rows from table pages.
- Returns the result.
